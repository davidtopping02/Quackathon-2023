# Dundee University 2023 Hackathon

We won the 2023 Dundee University Unity hackathon challenge which involved utilizing the Unity engine and at least one other service provided by Unity to create a project. Our team of four developed a 2D game that simulated a character's day within a time limit of 60 seconds. The character had to balance their work, eating, and socializing in the game. The game's primary objective was to help players strike a healthy balance between all aspects of their character's life to survive as many days as possible.

The biggest challenge of the project was maintaining a realistic scope to complete the game within 24 hours. Despite the challenge, we were able to create a functional game that efficiently organized code using the singleton and state design patterns. We also implemented Unity's cloud save functionality, which allows the character's health, social, and strength stats to remain the same regardless of where and when the game is loaded from.
